- 👋 Hi, I’m @Saniya-Ashraf
- 👀 I’m interested in Applied ML and explainable AI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects
  

## 🛡 Who Am I?
I'm an educator, a researcher, an engineer, an artist, a freelancer all rolled into one. 

### What Gets Me Out of Bed?
In one word—possibilities. The thrill of what AI and Deep Learning can accomplish in realms as varied as healthcare and video gaming energizes me. what facinates me is HOW DOES IT DO IT?. The idea that code can literally "see" and "learn" fascinates me to no end.

### 🧪 My Playground 
> 🌟 "Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning." - William Arthur Ward 🌟

When I'm not delivering lectures or getting lost in code, I venture into fascinating domains of AI and ML. 🤖
When not at work or in the classroom, I'm engrossed in a myriad of research projects. When not in the lecture hall or deeply engrossed in coding, I'm usually exploring the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My research has taken me from Applied ML/DL in real world problems. Whether you're fascinated by the intricate neural pathways of the human brain or the application of AI algorithms in unconventional fields, you're in the right place. I'm always excited about collaborative efforts, brainstorming new ideas, or engaging in a good academic debate, we should definitely talk.

So, whether you're a student, a fellow researcher, or someone equally passionate about the transformative power of technology, let's connect. Who knows what marvels we could create together?
